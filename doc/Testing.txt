Sporran testing comprises of the test suite under the tests directory.

This is split into formal API testing in the sporran_test.dart file and scenario testing in the
sporran_test_scenarioX.dart files.

These are standard unit test based tests which delete the test database on initiation so 
they can be run as standalone tests in any order. The tests in sporran_test.dart run with
change notifications and autoSync set to off where needed to allow formal API tests to be
performed without any interaction form other functional areas.

Test parameters are configured in the sporran_test_config.dart file which should be edited as needed
before running the tests.

Please see these files for more detailed information.

Note that some tests will be marked as 'DOM Error event' or some such, this is expected in the case
of conflicts or non-existant documents, all tests shouild pass if you have any errors other than the
above  these need to be investigated.
