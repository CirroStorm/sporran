Sporran testing comprises of the test suite under the tests directory.

This is split into formal API testing in the sporran_test.dart file and scenario testing in the
sporran_test_scenarioX.dart files. These file use the futures based API.

One other file is also included in the test suite, being sporran_test_completion.dart, this is
a copy of sorran_test.dart but uses the completion callback interface.

These are standard unit test based tests, the created database MUST be deleted in CouchDB
before each test suite is run. 

The tests in sporran_test.dart run with change notifications and autoSync set to off where 
needed to allow formal API tests to be performed without any interaction from other 
#functional areas.

Test parameters are configured in the sporran_test_config.dart file which should be edited as needed
before running the tests.

Please see these files for more detailed information.

Note that some tests will be marked as 'DOM Error event' or some such, this is expected in the case
of conflicts or non-existant documents, all tests shouild pass if you have any errors other than the
above  these need to be investigated.
