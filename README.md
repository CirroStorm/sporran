# Sporran - a PouchDB alike database client for Dart

## Introduction

Sporran is a PouchDB alike implementation for Dart.

It uses the Wilt CouchDB client and the Lawndart local storage client to allow users to
switch seamlessly between online and offline browser modes and carry on using their database.

When the browser is online Sporran acts just like Wilt, i.e is a CouchDB client, if the browser
goes offline Sporran switches to using local storage, when the browser comes back online the 
local database is synced with CouchDB, all transparent to the user.
